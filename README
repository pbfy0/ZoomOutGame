A web-based geography game. You are shown a place as a satellite image and must
choose the correct place name from a list. You can also zoom out (or in). Generally
it starts at a zoom level at which it is hard to recognize the place, and you
need to zoom out a few levels until you can see some distinctive geographic feature
such as coastline, river, mountain range, etc., in order to identify the place.

The python script gtrends.py takes up to 4 arguments, each of which is a google 
search term. It returns corresponding google trends values averaged over ____.
The way google trends works, it always normalizes such that the highest point is 100,
and the numbers for each search term are integers, so there is not much dynamic range.
If you put in two searches of wildly differing popularity the unpopular one will just 
be zero. So if you want e.g. to compare 'New York' and 'Owego', you need to find some
search of intermediate popularity, e.g. 
'New York' 'Buffalo'  ->  63.0, 8.9
'Buffalo'  'Ithaca'  ->  76.2, 8.7
'Ithaca'  'Owego'  -> 59.7, 2.71

So now we know that the 'New York' search is about

63/8.9 * 76.2/8.7 * 59.7/2.71  = 1366

times as popular as the 'Owego' search.
